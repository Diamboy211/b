Work harder: Go intergalactic without eternity upgrades. Reward: Eternity upgrades multipliers are x^1.1.
Something: Go intergalactic in a minute.
No fifth TD here!: Get a million time theorems.

ID = 56ND
TD = 8ID
GD = super-strong

Boost based on tickspeed multiplier decrease: x^0.02
Boost based on GP: x + 1
Boost based on intergalactics: x^log4(2x)
Boost based on unspent GT: x^(x^0.5)

Boost effects as given are on TD.
Effect on ID = effect on TD^10.
Effect on ND = effect on TD^1000.
Effect on GD = 1 + ln(effect on TD).

These things should have fairly large cost increases, I think.
What about being like TT, but the cost increment increasing each time they're bought?
That sounds good.

// The game is now balanced around this -3. The question is of course whether it is in the end unbalanced.
// Well, we can go like time^(4/3), so we can get to target in time target^(3/4), which is target^(3/4) / speed when speed is relevant.
// So if our initial speed is x^(1/3) we can get to the needed x^(1/2)
// in time which is x^(3/8) / x^(1/3) = x^(1/24), which is very close but should work. All we need to get to 1e1e308 is replicanti
// one trillion times faster overall, which we can do by having some small replicanti speed-boosting currency with production based on log(log(am))
// (or perhaps the square of that). The needed speed of replicanti is infinities to a small power.
// Indeed, this is what XD will be. You can buy xd with banked infinities, starting at 10T banked and increasing by 10x per.
// XD produce XP (which make replicanti (1 + XP / 1000)x faster). You start with 1 XP, and XD each produce 1 XP per second.
// There's also a "sacrifice" mechanic; you lose all your XD and XP, but XD price resets and XP produce 1 + ((total sacrificed XD) ** .5) / 1e3 XD per second.
// Also, by paying certain amounts of XD, you can get:
// 2x multiplier to XP production: starting at 10 XD, doubling each time.
// XP production is stronger by cube root of XD: starting at 10 XD, tripling each time.
// This isn't actually strong enough but it can probably be fixed so that it is.
