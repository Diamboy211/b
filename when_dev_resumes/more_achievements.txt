Perma-non-dilation: Get 13000 TT.
This is what...: As suggested. Reward: Time dimensions are multiplied by your total galactic theorems.

In the grim darkness of the far endgame: Get 1e40000 EP.
Work harder: Go intergalactic without eternity upgrades. Reward: Eternity upgrade multipliers are x^1.1.
A newer beginning: Begin generation of blackhole power.
I'm a mistake: Complete a blackhole challenge. Reward: Double blackhole power gain for each eternity challenge completed, and you can complete each eternity challenge 6 times, rather than 5.
Superluminal travel: Go intergalactic in under a minute. Reward: You start with 2e25 EP.
Yeah you definitely bend time: Get 9e999 tickspeed decrease per upgrade.
No XD!: Get 10 trillion banked infinities. Reward: Blackhole power affects infinity gain.
I want it all: Have at least one of each galactic study at a single time.

ID = 56ND
TD = 8ID
GD = super-strong

Boost based on tickspeed multiplier decrease: x^0.02
Boost based on GP: x + 1
Boost based on intergalactics: x^log4(2x)
Boost based on unspent GT: x^(x^0.5)

Boost effects as given are on TD.
Effect on ID = effect on TD^10.
Effect on ND = effect on TD^1000.
Effect on GD = 1 + ln(effect on TD).

These things should have fairly large cost increases, I think.
What about being like TT, but the cost increment increasing each time they're bought?
That sounds good.

Infinity power boosts GD: log(power)^(blackhole percentage / 5).
Same formula for antimatter boosting GD.
Replicanti galaxies are a huge part of the game, so the amount to which they are powered up is 1/10 usual powerup.
Also, galactic dimension multipliers are powered in the same way, so that it's not overwhelming.
