Work harder: Go intergalactic without eternity upgrades. Reward: Eternity upgrades multipliers are x^1.1.
Something: Go intergalactic in a minute.
No fifth TD here!: Get a million time theorems.

ID = 56ND
TD = 8ID
GD = super-strong

Boost based on tickspeed multiplier decrease: x^0.02
Boost based on GP: x + 1
Boost based on intergalactics: x^log4(2x)
Boost based on unspent GT: x^log4(2x)

Boost effects as given are on TD.
Effect on ID = effect on TD^10.
Effect on ND = effect on TD^1000.
Effect on GD = 1 + ln(effect on TD).

These things should have fairly large cost increases, I think.
What about being like TT, but the cost increment increasing each time they're bought?
That sounds good.
