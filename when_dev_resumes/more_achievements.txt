What actually goes here:
Can you get infinite TT?: Get 30008 TT.
I am speed: Get 1e2000 EP in an at-most 20-second eternity.
This thing all things devours: Get 1e10000 ticks per second without buying any dimensions in the current eternity.
The void: Go intergalactic.

5 more eternities until the update: Complete 50 unique eternity challenge tiers. Reward: Eternity challenge rewards are 5% stronger.
Eternal relationship: Have timeshards/sec exceed your current timeshards for 30 consecutive seconds. Reward: Eternity challenge 1 reward is 30% stronger.
We can still afford 9: Go intergalactic with exactly 9 replicanti galaxies. Reward: Replicanti galaxies are 0.9% stronger.
Slower than a potato^-1000: Get fewer than 1e-26000 ticks per second. Reward: Antigalaxies are 20% weaker.
YOU CAN GET -50 GALAXIES??!: Go intergalactic having had at least 50 antigalaxies for the whole intergalaxy. Reward: Tickspeed is halved by each antigalaxy.
I forgot to make it Decimal: Get 2^2074 tickspeed decrease per upgrade. Reward: Tickspeed decrease per upgrade is doubled.
Costco sells replicanti galaxies now: Bulk buy 750 replicanti galaxies at once. Reward: The formula for bulk replicanti galaxies is much better.
This is what I have to do to get rid of you.: Reach 1e66600 IP without any time studies, galactic studies, or eternity challenge completions. Reward: Time dimensions are multiplied by the total number of galactic theorems you have.

The supervoid: Go intergalactic in Eternity Challenge 5.
Work harder!: Go intergalactic without buying eternity upgrades. Reward: The first two rows of eternity upgrades are 10% stronger.
In the grim darkness of the far endgame: Get 1e40000 EP.
A trillion is a lot: Get 1e12 eternities. Reward: Eternity Upgrade 2 is much stronger.
Yeah you definitely bend time: Get 1e1000 tickspeed decrease per upgrade. Reward: Tickspeed decrease per upgrade is stronger based on tickspeed.
24 dimensions and none of them ninth...: Buy the fourth galactic dimension. Reward: Each fourth galactic dimension gives a 1.1x multiplier to all galactic dimensions.
Superluminal: Go extragalactic in 1 minute. Reward: Start intergalaxies with 1e25 EP.
Universal harmony: Have the same number (at least 100) of normal galaxies, replicanti galaxies, and intergalactic galaxies. Reward: All galaxies are 0.1% stronger.

(A trillion is a lot: EU2 becomes x^log4(2x)^2.5)
(Yeah you definitely bend time: max(1, -log10(tickspeed))^0.2)

ID = 56ND
TD = 8ID
GD = super-strong

Boost based on tickspeed multiplier decrease: x^0.02
Boost based on GP: x + 1
Boost based on intergalactics: x^log4(2x)
Boost based on unspent GT: x^(x^0.5)

Boost effects as given are on TD.
Effect on ID = effect on TD^10.
Effect on ND = effect on TD^1000.
Effect on GD = 1 + ln(effect on TD).

These things should have fairly large cost increases, I think.
What about being like TT, but the cost increment increasing each time they're bought?
That sounds good.

What we need to do: Update galactic dimensions every tick and give intergalactic galaxies, also all the galactic study stuff.

// The game is now balanced around this -3. The question is of course whether it is in the end unbalanced.
// Well, we can go like time^(4/3), so we can get to target in time target^(3/4), which is target^(3/4) / speed when speed is relevant.
// So if our initial speed is x^(1/3) we can get to the needed x^(1/2)
// in time which is x^(3/8) / x^(1/3) = x^(1/24), which is very close but should work. All we need to get to 1e1e308 is replicanti
// one trillion times faster overall, which we can do by having some small replicanti speed-boosting currency with production based on log(log(am))
// (or perhaps the square of that). The needed speed of replicanti is infinities to a small power.
// Indeed, this is what XD will be. You can buy xd with banked infinities, starting at 10T banked and increasing by 10x per.
// XD produce XP (which make replicanti (1 + XP / 1000)x faster). You start with 1 XP, and XD each produce 1 XP per second.
// There's also a "sacrifice" mechanic; you lose all your XD and XP, but XD price resets and XP produce 1 + ((total sacrificed XD) ** .5) / 1e3 XD per second.
// Also, by paying certain amounts of XD, you can get:
// 2x multiplier to XP production: starting at 10 XD, doubling each time.
// XP production is stronger by cube root of XD: starting at 10 XD, tripling each time.
// This isn't actually strong enough but it can probably be fixed so that it is.
