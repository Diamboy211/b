dilation:
- In IC3
- 10% of galaxies are dilated galaxies when exiting dilation (ceiling). Dilated galaxies act like galaxies
- upgrades cost dilated galaxies

Or just do dilation in vanilla:
- 1e6000 EP
- All formulas in dilation should be changed
- upgrades are intact, but with some more upgrades from NG++, NGUpdate (maybe not), etc.
