This repository just contains random stuff. It's like evil-misc, but unlike there, here the stuff is at least somewhat polished, intended to have a short URL, hosted by Github Pages. This sounds like the criteria for stuff meant for public consumption, and that's kind of the distinction.

In reality, this repository will probably end up being whatever it needs to be to prevent creation of additional repositories with nothing of interest to anyone.

Oh, and since you actually read the README: the solution to f'(x) = e^f(x) is -ln(-x) for x < 0.
