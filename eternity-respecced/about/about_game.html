  <h1>General information about Eternity Respecced</h1>
<p>
TLDR: I made a mod to Antimatter Dimension's eternity, it's <a href='../index.html'>here,</a> it's currently a lot shorter and somewhat slower than the original is now, it only becomes that different at eternity so you should probably start with a save at the start of second eternity (if you don't have such a save, import "et in aeternum ego").
</p>
<p>
Eternity Respecced is a mod I'm making of Antimatter Dimensions with the intension of not betraying you and thinking about the mathematical impacts of things before I do them. If I do need to nerf anything, it will be a consistent, whole-game nerf, not a nerf that only takes effect at a certain point.

The game is <a href='../index.html'>here.</a> Everything before eternity is the same, so start by importing a save at the start of second eternity, or by using the cheat code "et in aeternum ego". None of the betrayals are there, and I don't think there are any new ones. There are many fewer time studies. "Do you really need a guide for this?" is now sarcastic in the other direction (it should really be called "1e(1 million) is a lot", but I didn't want to create new achievement art). There aren't yet any eternity challenges (they will probably get added) or dilation (it probably won't). The current endgame is roughly (it's not less, it might be more) 5e6 eternity points, 1e2300 infinity points, 70 TT, eternity in 10 seconds, and all of the current achievements and eternity upgrades. The game's speed (in terms of how quickly you progress through material) is also more like the original game's early Eternity Challenges speed (slow) than the original game's early eternity speed (fast).

One might wonder how Eternity Respecced avoids going off to true infinity due to galaxies and time dimensions being too powerful. The answer is that tickspeed upgrades are not proportional to the exponent of timeshards, but instead to the square root of that exponent. This is achieved via time dimension tickspeed upgrade cost scaling. I really don't see why Antimatter Dimensions didn't do this, since it makes balancing a fair bit cleaner.

If you find a bug, hit a wall (more than 10 hours with no major progress), experience growth off to true infinity, get to the end of current content, have questions about the math/arithmetic in the design, or have any type of questions, comments, or suggestions, create a github issue or message me on the official AD discord.
