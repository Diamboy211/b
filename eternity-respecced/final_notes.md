usavictor's note: This is outdated, I have however changed the links so it works.

Eternity Respecced development is more-or-less stopping (exceptions given below). Also, I'm probably not going to be on Discord for a while (perhaps forever). The reason for this is that I currently think that AD (and its variants, and incremental games in general) are all mostly wastes of time (this refers to the act of playing them and, to a far lesser extent, coding them). This attitude I currently have might change, but I'm hoping that linking this in a way that people will see it will make me feel a bit embarrassed to change my mind.

Some important additional information and exceptions that someone should read:

Feel free to pin any of this in any of the ER channels. Also feel free not to pin it.

An email I check often can be obtained from the following (obfuscated to avoid automated scam): `'dragn(arte)phippoe lai nee(doom t)cloom'.replace(/(\w)\w/g, '$1').replace(/ /g, '')`

If you find a bug, feel free to make a bug report issue: I might or might not fix it, but knowing about bugs is better than not knowing about them.

If you want to indicate that this message has been seen and is known about, or if you have any questions, feel free to create an issue or email me, but don't feel obligated to.

I agree that this whole message is somewhat childish, but I didn't have the time to phrase it better, and I admit that in some ways I am childish. If anything here is impolite, I'm sorry. And I'm also sorry for, if not outright saying there would be an update, strongly implying it and then not delivering.

Don't feel that you need to change anything about the NG-- server based on this. If you want to ban me from the NG-- server, give me some dumbass-like role, or remove my mod status, feel free to (but of course you don't have to); if you want to do any of those things and can't (because I'm the original server creator, or because I'm a mod), inform me somehow and I'll log in and help as much as I can. Everything in the above sentence, except the part about me being the server creator and a mod, also applies to the vanilla AD server, if for some reason some mod there is reading this.

If you want to continue development of Eternity Respecced yourself, you should feel free to clone this repo, or just copy all or any part of it. Also, I might at some point feel strongly enough about AD that (with at least a week's advance notice) I take this repo down, so it might be a good idea for someone to make a copy of it.

If you want to hear about what exactly was planned for the next update (the intergalactic upgrade), especially if you want to continue development, create an issue and I'll reply.

I think the people who are regularly on the NG-- discord are all great (something I can't really say about the NG+++ discord); if anyone really wants to stay in touch with me concerning something other than purely AD (for example, math), I'm happy to. I could probably even be convinced to join a discord server about a non-AD thing.

I might be on discord for a short time a bit after any vanilla AD update comes out (the next one, and any other ones if Omsi or someone does more after that), just to see what the strategy is. I also might go on discord once every season or perhaps even once every month, just to see what's been going on. Apart from that, I don't expect to go on discord.

I can imagine that, in the case that I log onto discord once per season or once per month, I might try to do dev on those days, which would mean that dev would continue but be really slow. Even this isn't that likely, however.

If this repo gets a commit on April 1st saying that development is resuming, it's probably an April Fool's day joke. If this message is removed, however, it's not an April Fool's day joke and development is actually resuming.

This itself is not intended as a joke. I actually do plan to stop development.

Wow, you actually read to the bottom of this! Here's a link to another incremental game I made (much shorter, current content can probably be finished in a day): https://usavictor210.github.io/b/numbers-master/. I'm not going to do development on this game either, though.
